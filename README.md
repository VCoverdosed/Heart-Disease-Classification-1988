# Heart-Disease-Classification-1988

In this project, we will be analysing a Heart Disease dataset from 1988, consisting of data from Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland and Long Beach. In hopes of understanding the dataset and making predictions of presence of heart disease in a person, we will try to tackle a supervised and an unsupervised task. 

In supervised learning, we aim to run classification using 3 different models: logistic regression, supported vector machine(SVM), and decision tree, where model will be selected using cross-validation.  

While in unsupervised learning, we aim to do dimensionality reduction by using PCA and t-SNE, in hopes of exploring underlying relationships among variables and the major contributing variables. Though it is clear that even we do two models with the same aim, it might not necessarily give us the same result, nor a similar set of materials to interpret. Besides, in contrast to supervised learning, unsuperbvised learning does not have ground truth labels to evaluate against. Hence, a more thorough and non-numerical evluation will be carried out.
